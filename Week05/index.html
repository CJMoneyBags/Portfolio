  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <h4>Stack traces</h4>
  <p>
    An exception will also produce a stack trace.
    This is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point
    where the error occurred. Itâ€™s often not just a single function or method
    call that causes an error. A stack trace will work backwards from the point
    at which the error occurred to identify the original function or method
    that started the sequence. The example below shows how a stack trace
    can help you find where an error originates from:
  </p>
  <code>function three(){ unicorn(); }
    function two(){ three(); }
    function one(){ two(); }
    one();

    << index.html:13 Uncaught ReferenceError: unicorn is not defined at three (index.html:13) at two (index.html:17) at one (index.html:21) at index.html:24`</code>

      <p>In this example, we have three functions: function one() invokes
        function two(), which then invokes function three(). Function three()
        then invokes the unicorn() function that doesn't exist and causes an
        error. We can use the stack trace to work backwards and see that this
        error was caused by invoking the function one() in the first place.
      </p>
